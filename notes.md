# Notes

## Part 1: Coding (DS + Algo)

- geeks4geeks
- cracking the coding interview
- coding round on Phone + In-Person
- e.g: Generate permutation of a string
  - not to freeze
  - put effort to solve it
  - look for solution
  - handle corner cases
  - handle test cases
  - unit tests
- Practice by riting on paper

### Topic

- Greedy
- Devide n Conquer
- Dynamic Programming

### Architecture Design

- During coding where you focus most?
- Your style of coding...
  - Give answer with `examples`

- Knoledge on E2E design

**Example:**

- How to design a Recommendation System
  - Don't spend too much time on the Matrix Factorization and all
  - Look for bigger design perspective
  - How to design the system
  - How the `latency` will be affected if `1B` users hit the server
    - How to tackle that situation
  - How to handle the model size
  - Docker Loadfactor and Balancing etc....

## Part 2: ML Stat

- Basic ML
- Data Mining
- ML Usual Topic:
  - Class Imbalance
  - Missing Values
  - ...
- Bayes Theorem
- Puzzle
  - ML Puzzle
  - Bayes Theorem Puzzle (e.g: door opening ...)
  - Stat puzzle

## Behaviour Question

- What are the chanllenging situations you have faced and how did you tackle it?
  - any coding or designing situation.. Give answer with some example instead of some abstract answer


## Final Thought

- In any product company, even if for ML role, you need to have good Software Engineering skills
- it's 50-50 or 60-40 i.e 60% time software engineering and 40% time modelling etc.
